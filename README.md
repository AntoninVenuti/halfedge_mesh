#Halfedge Mesh
This is a small python library that will read OBJ and PLY mesh format files into
a halfedge data structure. A halfedge data structure has two edges for a given
edge in a mesh.



##Usage

    import halfedge_mesh
    
    # Either .off or .py are supported
    mesh = halfedge_mesh("my_meshes.off")
